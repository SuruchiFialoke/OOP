Review of functions and pointers. The examples from this week cover the following topics:

- Pointers
	- Addresses and values
	- Pointer arithmetics
- Functions
	- Pass by value
	- Pass by reference
- Arrays
	- Ways of passing an array to a function
	- Illustration that arrays are passed on a function by reference*

*Technically this is not passing by reference, but we are passing a pointer by value. However the behaviour is exactly the same.
